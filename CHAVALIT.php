Hi Montri,

Day 1 - Wednesday 22nd
  Just a quickie to let you know that I met Sally in reception and took Chavalit to his apartment. We had to wait for about 30 minutes before Hoy arrived with her sister (?)

  Chavalit was very happy and we all went for lunch at MK Restaurant at Big C. Hoy fed him and it was good to see them both happy. While I was still eating, Hoy disappeared and returned with Chavalits bank book, ATM card and cash to pay the bill. She is now aware of the total amount available for her services. If she is still here  after a week Carl and I will be most surprised. Perhaps we are cynical but are both experienced and seen it far too many times.

  A couple of questions, first, please translate the medication details and secondly, Chavalit's available cash is going to run out very quickly. How will his funds be topped up?

  Please excuse any spellings, etc, I have just returned from seeing Carl and have had a coupled of nightcaps :)


Day 2 - Thursday 23rd
  Chavalit called about 10:00 and said he was going somewhere with Hoy and would not be back until about 20:00. We had previously made tentative plans for lunch about 13:30. Although his voice was weak, I was delighted to be able to hear him speaking.

  Chavalit called from the internal apartments telephone system about 16:30 and said that there was little money in his bank account and he wanted me to "call his brother for more money". I explained about the lawyer depositing an allowance on a regular basis and could be withdrawn using the ATM card. He reckons he would check and report back. 


Day 3 & 4 - Friday and Saturday 24th, 25th, were bl@@dy chaotic
  It has been eventful and not sure of what was mentioned in the last Line call but as you know Day 3 Hoy left Jeffrey alone about 21:00 and I called next morning after a morning swim and found him half out of bed... 

  Carl and I hosed him down in the toilet to clean the shitty mess. Took him to Senior Nursing Home and turned away. Called in to Golden Years on the way back and he liked the place but wanted to wait until Thursday for reasons I later discovered was a plan to fly to Surin.

  I stayed and had an 'Orrible night, woken every fifteen minutes until effectually I said BOLLICKS at 03:00, put all the lights out, switched off the TV and told him not to disturb me with trivial requests.

  Day 4 - Saturday 25th, declined to lend him 5,000 Baht and laughed, scoffed, abusive, condescending, downright crude, etc when I learnt the money was for a flight to Surin!

  Took him for lunch... returned to the apartment's office about 17:00 and told to go and catch up on my sleep, my services were no longer required because he was going back to St Louis Hospital...

  Woken an hour later and asked to go to the office. I returned his ATM that I had saved in card he lost it and told he needed money to pay for two female helpers to stay the night. I updated bank book and he had about 35,000 Baht.

  I just had a lengthy chat with a friend from UK that has lived in Thailand for about fifteen years and vented my frustrations.  Now calm, about to have my nightcap and read my book.

  Call on Line if you fancy a chat in the next hour.


Day 5 - Sunday 26th
  I did not see or speak with Chavrilit all day Sunday.


Day 6 -  Monday 27th 11:30am
  At your request I called down to see if he was OK. He wanted to know why I called to see him and I told him we were concerned.

  The carer from the hospital was with Chavalit on Sunday and Monday.

  After checking on Chavalit the carer called about 14:00. I went down and Chavalit wanted to know when Noi from  Roiet was coming to Bangkok :)

  I took him for lunch, fish burger, chips, big cola, ice-cream and sweets. He did not want the carer to go with us to Big C?

  I gave the carer 100 Baht for Chinese New Year and told her to look after Chavalit.


Day 7 -  Tuesday 28th
  I did not see or speak with Chavalit all day Monday.


Day 8 -  Wednesday 29th 
  On the way to lunch I met the carer in the apartment foyer, she was reading the paper and said that Chavalit was sleeping. I left and continued to Big C for lunch.
  Chavalit telephoned after lunch so I called down to see him and stayed for about an hour. I told him to call me the next day for lunch.


  Please note the previous date was Wednesday 29th


  I called in with Charlie from Hong Kong after lunch about 15:00. spent an hour and Charlie stayed for another hour. I took Chavalit an ice-cream and he thoroughly enjoyed it. He is still very weak and pleased that he has clean clothes and Pampers. The carer was there with her husband and they left shortly after we arrived possibly to shop or eat.

Day 9 -  Thursday 30th 
  Chavalit called about 08:30 and wanted to go for lunch so I met him in the office at 13:30 with his carer. I went to Big C, met Charlie and we went for a KFC. Returned and left Chavalit in the office with his carer. Chavalit wants to go to St Louis Hospital, he was complaining about asthma in the middle of the night. I think it was a sudden impulse because he had looked far worse on previous occassions. I mentioned and got no response about going to GoldenYears Nursing Home. I should imagine he will want to go out tomorrow for lunch.

John
